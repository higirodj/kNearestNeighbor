# kNearestNeighbor
I. kNN algorithm implementation in Python.
II. File list: kNN.py, iris.training.data.txt, iris.names.txt
III. Command line arguments in order to run the kNN implementation:

    ./kNN.py 

	or 

    python kNN.py
    
IV. An instance of the Iris data is used in order to show that the algorithm
    is implemented correctly. The test object can be changed to classify other
    Iris flowers. The data set was obtained from the UCI repository.
